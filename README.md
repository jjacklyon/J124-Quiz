# J124-Quiz
## Why I picked this question.
##### I chose to assess the question "On a 6 hour flight from NYC to LA, how many times is it acceptable to get up if you're not in an aisle seat?" as I have taken many of these coast to coast flights and often worry I get up too much. Taking a look at the data, I seem to get up about the same amount as people generally find appropriate for such a flight.
